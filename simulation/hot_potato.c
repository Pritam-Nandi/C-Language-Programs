Program: Hot Potato Simulation
File: simulation/hot_potato.c
Category: Simulation / Algorithms
---------------------------------------------------------
Problem Statement:
------------------
N players stand in a circle, numbered 1 to N.
A "hot potato" is passed around the circle.
Every K-th pass eliminates the player holding the potato.
The game continues until only one player (the winner) remains.

Input:
N (number of players)
K (number of passes before elimination)

Output:
Elimination order and the final winner.

---------------------------------------------------------
Sample Input:
5
3

Sample Output:
Elimination order: 3 1 5 2
Winner: 4
---------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm:
----------
1. Initialize an array `players` from 1 to N (all active).
2. Maintain a counter for how many players remain.
3. Use a circular index and count K active players each round.
4. Eliminate the K-th player and mark them as 0.
5. Repeat until only one player remains.

Time Complexity:  O(N Ã— K)
Space Complexity: O(N)
